Release notes (March 2022)

New projects:

[autodiff]
 Automatic differentiation (T51909, T50868)
 The goal with this is to have re-usable and generic layers of abstraction for 
 automatic differention. At 1 layer, a user provides an 'objective' listing which 
 tensors to target (to get gradients for), which tensors to start from (gradients 
 provided) and which tensors are checkpointed (do not require recomputation). At 
 another, the user completes an abstract base class for constructing ops in a 
 graph in their project. This project does not do any 'calculus', that level of 
 abstraction is handled by the external project using poprithms. 

[program] 
  Basic classes for analysis of call stacks (T55765, T55929, T55941, T56371)
  Currently there is (1) support for determing which ops are run, and in which 
  call scopes, and (2) for decomposing programs by device (or any other field). 


Projects with extensions/improvements:

[memory::alias] 
  Changes to the alias graph and tensor classes to support external projects
  requiring alias analysis without poplar. (T55482, T53969, T53969, T53969, T56243)

[memory::inplace] 
  More refined ambiguity detection (under-constrained order of operation 
  execution, resulting in undefined numerical behaviour). (T47848, T56597)

[memory::chain] 
  Improved chain simplification. (T52316, T53079, T53919, T54574, T53918)

[memory::unwind] 
  Ability to unwind through expand ops (T53025) and to specify the order in 
  which unwind paths should be unwound (T53086)
